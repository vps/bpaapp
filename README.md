Here is a detailed outline with steps, pseudocode, and references for how to switch from Forte to Fiserv for payment processing:

## Task 1: Steps needed to switch from Forte to Fiserv

1. Set up OAuth authentication with Fiserv (BPAPI Reference Guide pgs 26-31)
    - Register our application and get client ID and secret key
    - Implement client credentials grant OAuth flow to get access tokens
    - Cache access tokens and refresh when expired (every 15 mins)

2. Create session tokens (BPAPI Reference Guide pgs 34-37) 
    - Call `POST /v1/session/start/execute` with biller ID and customer identifiers
    - Pass session token in header for all subsequent requests

3. Validate billing accounts (BPAPI Reference Guide pgs 80-89)
    - Call `POST /v1/billingAccount` to validate billing account
    - Can retrieve associated payment models, scheduled payments etc.

4. Generate funding account tokens (BPAPI Reference Guide pgs 38-42)
    - Call `POST /v1/fundingAccounts` with card or bank details
    - Get one-time use token to represent funding account

5. Make immediate payments (BPAPI Reference Guide pgs 46-51)
    - Call `POST /v1/payments` with billing account, payment details
    - Pass funding account token to make payment
    - Can add token to wallet for future use

6. Schedule future payments (BPAPI Reference Guide pgs 113-124)
    - Call `POST /v1/schedule` to create one-time future payment
    - Use `PUT` and `GET` to update and retrieve scheduled payments

7. Manage customer wallet (BPAPI Reference Guide pgs 125-143) 
    - Call `POST /v1/walletFundingAccounts` to add funding accounts
    - Use `PUT` and `GET` to update and retrieve wallet items
    - Call `DELETE` to remove wallet items

8. Set up recurring payments (BPAPI Reference Guide pgs 56-68)
    - Call `POST /v1/recurring` to create recurring payment
    - Use `PUT`, `GET` and `DELETE` to manage recurring payments

9. Set up AutoPay payments (BPAPI Reference Guide pgs 96-111)
    - Call `POST /v1/autopayments` to create AutoPay payment
    - Use `PUT`, `GET` and `DELETE` to manage AutoPay

10. Get payment history (BPAPI Reference Guide pg 72)
    - Call `POST /v1/paymentHistory` to retrieve customer history

## Task 2: Task breakdown for implementation

1. Set up back-end integration
    - Implement OAuth authentication flow
    - Create wrappers for BPAPI resources (sessions, billing accounts etc.) 
    - Build repositories/DB models for customer data 

2. Update front-end with new flows
    - New payment forms for cards/ACH 
    - Pages for wallet management
    - Scheduled/recurring payment management
    - Update payment confirmation page with new data

3. Integration and end-to-end testing
    - Start with unit tests for back-end API wrappers
    - Write integration tests for payment flows
    - Manual testing across different use cases

4. Deployment
    - Deploy back-end changes incrementally
    - Deploy front-end changes after back-end is stable
    - Redirect Forte endpoints to Fiserv equivalents

5. Migration
    - Move existing customer data to new data models
    - Migrate scheduled/recurring payments
    - Replay payment history into new database

6. Cleanup
    - Remove Forte integrations
    - Monitor logs/metrics for issues
    - Address any bugs or issues

## Pseudocode

```
// Get access token
clientId = CONFIG.fiserv.clientId 
secret = CONFIG.fiserv.secret

tokenResponse = callOAuth(clientId, secret)
accessToken = tokenResponse.accessToken

// Create session
billerId = CONFIG.billerId
customerId = getCustomerId() 

sessionRequest = {
  billerId: billerId,
  customerId: customerId
}

sessionResponse = callCreateSession(sessionRequest, accessToken)
sessionToken = sessionResponse.sessionToken

// Make immediate payment
paymentRequest = {
  billingAccount: customer.billingAccount,
  amount: 99.95,
  // other payment details...
}

callMakePayment(paymentRequest, sessionToken, accessToken)

// Get payment history
historyRequest = {
  fromDate: "2023-01-01", 
  toDate: "2023-02-01" 
}

paymentHistory = callGetPaymentHistory(historyRequest, sessionToken, accessToken)
```

Here is a detailed outline for how to switch from Forte to Fiserv for payment processing. The steps cover implementing OAuth authentication, creating sessions, validating billing accounts, generating funding tokens, making payments, scheduling future payments, managing customer wallets, setting up recurring/AutoPay payments, and retrieving payment history.

Here is a detailed outline of the steps needed to switch from Forte to Fiserv for payment processing:

1. Review Integration Options
- Read through the BPAPI Supplemental Implementation Guide to understand the different integration options (BPAPI, JavaScript Proxy, iFrame) and determine which one makes the most sense based on the bank's needs, resources, and risk tolerance. 

2. Plan Implementation Approach
- Based on integration option chosen, review the BPAPI Reference Guide to plan out endpoints and operations needed to support required use cases (e.g. make payment, schedule payment, manage wallet). 
- Identify any gaps between current capabilities with Forte and what will be possible with Fiserv BPAPI. Make plan to address gaps.

3. Setup Authentication
- Work with Fiserv to setup OAuth authentication. This involves provisioning a client in their system and obtaining client ID, client secret (BPAPI Reference Guide).
- Implement support for requesting OAuth tokens from Fiserv server (BPAPI Reference Guide).

4. Build Integration 
- Using chosen integration option, start building out integration with Fiserv BPAPI using details from YAML file and guides.
- Start with core payment operations (BPAPI Reference Guide).
- Build reusable components for common needs like creating sessions, tokens.
- Incorporate additional operations like scheduling payments, wallet management (BPAPI Supplemental Guide).

5. Test Integrations
- Leverage Fiserv test environments to thoroughly test integrations.
- Start with unit and integration testing individual operations.
- Expand to end-to-end testing of critical customer workflows around payments.
- Iterate as needed to address issues found.

6. Switch Over
- Whenintegrations are thoroughly tested, finalize rollout plan and timeline.
- Consider running Fiserv and Forte in parallel during switchover period.
- Monitor switchover and address any issues immediately.

7. Clean Up
- After switchover, clean up unneeded Forte integrations, tokens, keys.
- Run security audits to ensure no lingering vulnerabilities.

*   Task 1: I need to implement an OAuth client that connects to a bank's REST API. Can you provide me with pseudo code for how to do this? The bank uses OAuth 2.0 for authentication.

Task 2: Here is some pseudo code for implementing an OAuth 2.0 client to connect to a bank's REST API in Python:

```python
# Client registration
client_id = 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID' # Provided by bank during registration
client_secret = 'YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET' # Provided by bank 

# Authorization URL
authorize_url = 'https://bank.com/oauth/authorize' 

# Token URL 
token_url = 'https://bank.com/oauth/token'

# API endpoints base URL
base_url = 'https://api.bank.com/'

# Redirect user to authorize URL
# User logs in and authorizes access 

# Handle redirect and get authorization code from query parameters

# Exchange authorization code for access token
data = {
    'grant_type': 'authorization_code',
    'code': authorization_code, 
    'redirect_uri': 'YOUR_REDIRECT_URI'
}

response = requests.post(token_url, 
                         auth=(client_id, client_secret),
                         data=data)

access_token = response.json()['access_token']

# Call API 
headers = {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer ' + access_token  
}

response = requests.get(base_url + 'accounts', headers=headers)

print(response.json())
```

This covers the main steps:

1. Client registration to get client credentials
2. Redirect user to bank's authorization URL 
3. Exchange authorization code for access token
4. Call API using access token

Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional requirements!
